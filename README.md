# The More, The Marriott!
The More, The Marriott Dictionary Project: Gotta catch 'em all, but make it Mifare! Constantly updated master repo of mfc dictionary files. Also see respective forks.

Usual disclaimer: This is an independent research project, my employer has nothing to do with this etc etc, don't do anything illegal, I'm not your mom.

## What this includes
* Masterlist of all static keys found with TMTM keycard horde, as detailed as possible for research purposes with as much information as we could meaningfully (remember to) include.
* Dict files in their current form that have been recently submitted to various projects. Also please free to yoink them from my forks, otherwise they'll show up in the repos proper eventually.

It recently came to my attention that there are "bloated" keys in, at minimum, the f0 unleashed fork's default mfc dictionary. This is my ghost typing. I am internally screaming into the void. _This will not do._

Please consider me the weird dictionary person, if you will.

## Experimental f0 Builds
Work in progress. This is mainly a dictionary project, after all. Check out the cool kid forks.

## Holy crap, how many cards do you have in the horde?
A lot. I have a lot. It's nice to have friends who travel for work.

## Got cards?
Please feel free to reach out to me and we'll go from there.

## Suggestions for best practices
* Formatting for readability (see: f0 stock firmware default dict for reference)
* Include card type (1k and its classic siblings) in comment, the source (hotel system, transit, access card, other) , location (if known), or if unknown
* When submitting a PR to a project, please verify that your keys are, in fact, static and not dynamic. You will absolutely be asked this if submitting a PR to pm3. Be specific! Otherwise it's crap research.
