# The More, The Marriott!
The More, The Marriott Dictionary Project: Gotta catch 'em all, but make it Mifare! Constantly updated master repo of mfc dictionary files. Also see respective forks.

Usual disclaimer: This is an independent research project, my employer has nothing to do with this etc etc, don't do anything illegal, I'm not your mom.

I don't know what I'm doing more than half the time, so maybe someone ~~smarter~~ more capable than me can take this data and, I dunno, besides adding to the dictionary files out there, help improve what's already out there? Something something orgs choosing convenience over security something something.

Thoughts, suggestions, ways to organize this better, anything you would like me to pull from the horde -- please let me know. I am very dumb. I see the tag flag as Ultralight and I go "lol nope i'm not doing that, i'm not even level 5 yet". Sharing is caring!

## What this includes
* Masterlist of all static keys found with TMTM keycard horde, as detailed as possible for research purposes with as much information as we could meaningfully (remember to) include.
* Dict files in their current form that have been recently submitted to various projects. Also please free to yoink them from my forks, otherwise they'll show up in the repos proper eventually.

It recently came to my attention that there are "bloated" keys in, at minimum, the f0 unleashed fork's default mfc dictionary. This is my ghost typing. I am internally screaming into the void. _This will not do._

Please consider me the weird dictionary person, if you will.

I _am_ working on this -- this repo just isn't as synced as I would like it to be. Please check out my PRs and/or forks to individual projects in the meantime. They're higher on my priority list. (Proxmark3, Flipper-Xtreme)

## Experimental f0 Builds
Work in progress. This is mainly a dictionary project, after all. Check out the cool kid forks.

## Holy crap, how many cards do you have in the horde?
A lot. I have a lot. It's nice to have friends who travel for work.

## Got cards?
Please feel free to reach out to me and we'll go from there. 

I recently was loaned a wristband from a hotel chain to look at. It read as Mifare 1k on my Flipper, and then Ultralight on the pm3 (interesting!). I'll accept your Flipper keyfiles but I prefer to see the physical keycards for The Horde (and will give them back, I already have such an agreement with one person in place).

## Suggestions for best practices
* Formatting for readability (see: f0 stock firmware default dict for reference)
* Include card type (1k and its classic siblings) in comment, the source (hotel system, transit, access card, other) , location (if known), or if unknown
* When submitting a PR to a project, please verify that your keys are, in fact, static and not dynamic. You will absolutely be asked this if submitting a PR to pm3. Be specific! Otherwise it's crap research.
