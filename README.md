# The More, The Marriott!
The More, The Marriott Dictionary Project: Gotta catch 'em all, but make it Mifare! Constantly updated master repo of mfc dictionary files. Also see respective forks.

Usual disclaimer: This is an independent research project, my employer has nothing to do with this etc etc, don't do anything illegal, I'm not your mom.

I don't know what I'm doing more than half the time, so maybe someone ~~smarter~~ more capable than me can take this data and, I dunno, besides adding to the dictionary files out there, help improve what's already out there? Something something orgs choosing convenience over security something something.

Thoughts, suggestions, ways to organize this better, anything you would like me to pull from the horde -- please let me know. I am very dumb. I see the tag flag as Ultralight and I go "lol nope i'm not doing that, i'm not even level 5 yet". Sharing is caring!

## What this includes
* Masterlist of all static keys found with TMTM keycard horde, as detailed as possible for research purposes with as much information as we could meaningfully (remember to) include.
* Dict files in their current form that have been recently submitted to various projects. Also please free to yoink them from my forks, otherwise they'll show up in the repos proper eventually.

It recently came to my attention that there are "bloated" keys in, at minimum, the f0 unleashed fork's default mfc dictionary. This is my ghost typing. I am internally screaming into the void. _This will not do._

Please consider me the weird dictionary person, if you will.

I _am_ working on this -- this repo just isn't as synced as I would like it to be. Please check out my PRs and/or forks to individual projects in the meantime. They're higher on my priority list. (Proxmark3, Flipper-Xtreme)

## Experimental f0 Builds
Work in progress. This is mainly a dictionary project, after all. Check out the cool kid forks.

## Holy crap, how many cards do you have in the horde?
A lot. I have a lot. It's nice to have friends who travel for work.

## Got cards?
Please feel free to reach out to me and we'll go from there. 

I recently was loaned a wristband from a hotel chain to look at. It read as Mifare 1k on my Flipper, and then Ultralight on the pm3 (interesting!). I'll accept your Flipper keyfiles but I prefer to see the physical keycards for The Horde (and will give them back, I already have such an agreement with one person in place).

## Future plans
~~head empty no thoughts~~

I keep kicking around the idea of writing up a practical pentester's playbook for the Flipper Zero.

There may or may not be a talk in the works, but I don't know what I'm doing more than half the time so idek.

## Considerations (but really a secondary disclaimer and some thoughts regarding ethics)
Amazon just very recently put the banhammer on selling Flipper Zero devices through their platform. I believe the same is true for eBay as well. 

Something that I've been grappling with while playing with these badges like a total weirdo as a researcher is the ethics of it all, because here's the thing -- fellow researchers and pentesters can make use of these findings and contributions, as well as bad actors. But we live in a world with an ever changing meta, to borrow competitive gamer speak, which in other terms, we'd call a constantly evolving threat landscape. The genie is already out of the bottle. I'm disclosing what I've found and making note of it in the hopes that vendors and the entities implementing these products improve their security posture. For all we know, maybe somebody has a better Mifare Pokedex than any of us that they're not sharing, and that should worry you.

Any intrepid nerd with the right tools and dev boards could build their own Proxmark or similar if they were so inclined. 

To be honest, I think it's great that the Flipper is restricted to the mainstream store. With great power comes great responsibility, or something like that. I don't know, my Spider-Man shirt is in the wash. 

It is of my opinion that we should consider security with a holistic, comprehensive approach, and not with some dumb slapstick band-aid solution that'll work until the band-aid gets wet. Yeah I know that's a terrible metaphor but I don't really care. _Do better_.

## Suggestions for best practices
* Formatting for readability (see: f0 stock firmware default dict for reference)
* Include card type (1k and its classic siblings) in comment, the source (hotel system, transit, access card, other) , location (if known), or if unknown
* When submitting a PR to a project, please verify that your keys are, in fact, static and not dynamic. You will absolutely be asked this if submitting a PR to pm3. Be specific! Otherwise it's crap research.
